						<h2>biography</h2>
						<p>Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie is best known for his work on computer languages and operating systems ALTRAN, B, BCPL, C, Multics, and especially Unix. For a man who did not start out in the computer industry, he has had a profound influence on the entire computer programming world. He told Investor's Business Daily , "It's not the actual programming that's interesting. But it's what you can accomplish with the end results that are important." And if that is the case, then Ritchie has had an important effect on most, if not all, computer users today.</p>
						<p>Ritchie was born on September 9, 1941, in Bronx-ville, New York. Ritchie grew up in New Jersey, and after a childhood in which he did very well academically, he went on to attend Harvard University. There he studied science and graduated with a bachelor's degree in physics. While he was still going to school, Ritchie happened to go to a lecture about how Harvard's computer system, a Univac I, worked. He was fascinated by what he heard and wanted to find out more. Outside of his Harvard studies, Ritchie began to explore computers more thoroughly, and was especially interested in how they were programmed.</p>

						<h3>Released uNIX OS</h3>
						<p>
							Bell Labs, frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not the aims, 
							slowly pulled out of the project. Their last researchers to leave Multics, Ken Thompson,
							Dennis Ritchie, Doug McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna among others, decided to redo the work on a 
							much smaller scale. In 1972, Dennis Ritchie described their vision for Unix

						<h3>Released C Language</h3>
						<p>
							C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs,
							and used to re-implement the Unix operating system. It has since become one of 
							the most widely used programming languages of all time, with C compilers from 
							various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures 
							and operating systems.

							For their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation
							of the UNIX operating system
